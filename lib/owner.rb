# An owner will know about all its pets, be able to buy a pet,
# set the name of a pet (which the pet can't change, because that would be weird),
# change a pet's mood through walking, feeding, or playing with it,
# and sell all of its pets (for when it moves to that tiny NYC studio after college).
